**White Water Reporting (Euphrates) - Issue Tracking System**

**Developers:** Cole Anderson, Christian Walker, Michael Wynnychuk, Radek Lewandowski

**Description:**

The new and improved issue tracking system from White Water Reporting utilizes state of the art restbed and JSON libraries to offer seamless client & server communication. Our product offers a simple yet efficient user interface which supplies users with the core functionality they really need (and not those bloated extra features like searching and updating, who needs those!). User functionality includes, and is limited to:

- Issue creation & deletion (the meat and potatoes of the system)
- Adding attributes to issues such as: title, description, operating system, type of issue, author, and assignee (if your issue is on MacOS, it's probably just MacOS)
- User account creation & deletion (only your own account, don't be mean)
- Commenting on specific issues (tell them how you really feel!)
- Logging out & logging in (we're especially proud of this one)
- Exiting the program (arguably the most important feature of all)

**How to use our product:**

In order to use our system, we have devised an easy to follow set of instructions which will eliminate any hassle and have you on your way to handling those pesky issues in no time!

1. Clone or download our repository into the directory of your choice.
2. Once downloaded, open a terminal window and switch into the directory where the program folder is located.
3. Once in the proper directory, enter the command "make server". This will start running the server for the program.
4. After you have the server running, open a new terminal window and switch into the same directory as before, just like in step 2. Once in the proper directory, enter the command "make client". This will then start running the client which will also display the user interface for the system.
5. At this point, the issue tracking system is running and you will be able to create a new account, create issues, and add comments to your hearts desire.
6. Once you are done with the program (like we are), select the option to exit the program and the client will shut down. NOTE: You will still need to manually shut down the server by exiting the terminal.
7. If you require adding, removing, or commenting on any further issues, simply follow steps 2-5 again and your previous issues will be loaded again from a saved file.
